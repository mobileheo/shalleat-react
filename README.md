## Getting Started

This application needs backend server that provides REST API to authenticate users and recieve restaurant data. In Prerequisites, there is an instruction to clone that server as well.

### Prerequisites

1.  You need to install npm or yarn.
2.  You need to get Google Map API and Google Place API(for backend) here is link (https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/)
3.  Assign google map api key to `googleMapAPI`. You can find this variable by typing ðŸ‘‡ in terminal after you clone this repository.

```
$ cd ShallEat-React
$ open src/requests/example_configuration.jsgit@github.com:sunny-heo/ShallEat-API.git
```

### Installing

This command to set up REST API server. (100% JavaScript)

```
$ git clone git@github.com:sunny-heo/ShallEat-API.git
```

The rest of setup instruction for the server is available here ðŸ‘‡:

This command to clone ShallEat-React application (98% JavaScript)

```

```

Install packages with npm or yarn

```

```

Run server

```
$ npm start
$ yarn start
```

\*\* Since this application is running by fetching data from the server, if you did't set up and run ShallEat-API server yet, this application will not work as expected.
